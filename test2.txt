Project Gutenberg FAQ 2002

I have a question not answered in this FAQ. How do I ask it?

If it's about how to produce a text, the Volunteers' Board at
<http://www.gutenberg.net/vol/wwwboard/> is generally the best
place to ask.

If it's a question of active interest to the general body of
volunteers, you can ask it on the gutvol-d mailing list. See
<http://www.gutenberg.net/subs.html> for joining it.

For other questions, you should check our Contact Information page at
<http://www.gutenberg.net/contactinfo.html> and e-mail the appropriate
person.
